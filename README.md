# GitJobs - HackUPC2022 Challenge Project InfoJobs

GitJobs is an **integration** showcase for **GitHub** and **InfoJobs**.

The goal is that an person looking for a **job in IT** can use the information in their **GitHub profile** to search **offers of interest**.

The search is based on the **programming languages** and **areas of IT** of the **repositories of the user owns, stars, and watches**.

The **bio** is also taken into consideration if the user has **clear preferences**, e.g. *"I love web dev","I'm a software engineer"*...

Then the info collected is used to **query InfoJobs API** and retrieve offers that **match the interests** of the user.

In the future **more integrations** could be done, to make it **easier** for users to get **attractive offers and find the job they're looking for**.
